# Introduction
This is a video creator tool intended to aid those
who have a stock photo content type, just like me.

# Instructions
IF YOU ARE ON  GITHUB: 
it doesn't work locally :(, for the repl instead:
[https://replit.com/@m1dnightdev/Stock-Photo-Content-Type-Automatic-Image-Downloader?v=1]

The first thing you need to do is fork the repl, good on 
you if you already have done that. You want to upload the
video you want to generate stock photos for.

Upload it, and then run the script. It will prompt you to
type in a file name. Just type in the name of the video you
just uploaded. Then wait for the sacript to finish. It take
a little to run.

# Important Info [READ!!]
It will download google ui elements too, for some reason. I 
tried to delete the using the 'os' module, but it didn't work.
You're requested image should be the fifth one. ALSO: there
will be some images that don't return results. Those are just
words that didn't get a result one search, maybe because it just
doesn't have stock photos.

I also made a video about this! It will be uploaded soon, so stay
tuned for that!
