# Introduction
This is a video creator tool intended to aid those
who have a stock photo content type, just like me.

# Instructions
**IF YOU ARE ON GITHUB:**
it doesn't work locally :(, for the repl instead:
[https://replit.com/@m1dnightdev/Stock-Photo-Content-Type-Automatic-Image-Downloader?v=1]

The first thing you need to do is fork the repl, good on 
you if you already have done that. You want to upload the
video you want to generate stock photos for.

Upload it, and then run the script. There will be a button
labeled "Upload Video". Please click this button and select
your video. Then the script will run for a little before
asking for a blacklist level. 0 is none and 3 is max.

# *IMPORTANT* For Forkers
I specifically made this project open source for forkers who
may want to alter the code to do what they want.

I want to place some rules down before you begin.
Please refrence [LICENSE.md] for info.

Most of the following is person rules astray from the creative
commons zero license used:
- In [CREDITS.md], please add your name in a similar format to mine
  - Please do not delete my section in [CREDITS.md]
  - Please use the following format accurately:
    - You should be credited as co-author
    - Your name should be in italics *like this*
    - Your links should be in bullet points with links
  - Do not take this project as your own, especially if forked
    With no change to the script
